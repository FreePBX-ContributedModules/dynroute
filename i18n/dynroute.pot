msgid "Instructions"
msgstr ""

msgid "You use the Dynamic Routing module to route calls based on sql lookup."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to request user input (dtmf) and then use that in the "
"query too."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optionally an announcement can be played before reading dtmf."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need to specify hostname, database name, username and password for mysql "
"server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the query you can use the special string [NUMBER] to be substituted by "
"the incoming callerid number"
msgstr ""

msgid "or the special string [INPUT] to be substituted by the captured dtmf."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The selected field returned from the query is matched against the options "
"text to decide which destination to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optionally you may define variable names in order to capture the dtmf input "
"and / or query result. Those variables may"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"be used later on a further pass through a dynroute inside the query string "
"be enclosing in [] or in custom destinations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When refering to the variables in custom destinations (typically to pass to "
"an agi script) DYNROUTE_ is prefixed to the variable name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should define an option named default which will be used if no match is "
"found. If you do not the call will be hang up on no match."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have defined a default option you may also omit the mysql hostname "
"and other parameters in order to bypass a query and"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"procede with the default action. This is useful if you only want to capture "
"dtmf into a variable without a mysql lookup."
